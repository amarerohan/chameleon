# CHAMELEON

The repository provides code templates for teaching related to *C*omputational and m*A*thematical *ME*thods in machine *LE*arning, *O*ptimization and i*N*ference (**ChAMELEON**).


## Requirements

Written and tested under `Python 3.12.2`. 

### Modules

The modules required to run this code are
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `requests`
- `matplotlib`


This modules can be installed via `pip`:
```
python3 -m pip install <module name>
```

To simply the installation of these modules, I have added a bash file called `install.sh` that you can execute to install the required libraries.
